# Online shop design with Cassandra (and python)

## What is this?
This project has two type of source files:
- `.cql` files with the creation of the tables
- `.py` files with the scripts to fill the tables with pseudo-random data

## Why?
I've created this little project to help me with the design task of a Cassandra's course.
